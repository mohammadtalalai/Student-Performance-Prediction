    <h1>Student Performance Prediction</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project aims to build a Machine Learning model to predict student performance based on various features such as demographic data, academic background, and other relevant factors. By predicting performance, educators and institutions can intervene early to support students at risk and improve overall academic outcomes.</p>

   <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Understanding and predicting student performance is crucial in modern education systems. Early identification of students at risk of underperforming can help tailor interventions to meet their needs. This project leverages Machine Learning to predict students’ final grades based on multiple attributes.</p>
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop a predictive model for student performance using historical data.</li>
        <li>Identify key factors influencing student success or failure.</li>
        <li>Provide actionable insights for educators to intervene and improve student outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset used for this project consists of student records from a specific institution. It includes various features such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Demographic attributes</strong>:  Hours Sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic features</strong>: previous grades, study time, attendance, etc.</li>
    </ul>
   
   <h2>Modeling Process</h2>

  <h3>1. Data Preprocessing</h3>
   <ul>
        <li><strong>Cleaning</strong>: Removing or imputing missing values.</li>
        <li><strong>Encoding</strong>: Converting categorical features to numerical values.</li>
        <li><strong>Normalization</strong>: Scaling numeric data for better model performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Splitting</strong>: Dividing data into training, validation, and test sets.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>2. Feature Selection</h3>
  <p>Key features were identified using correlation analysis and feature importance techniques. Attributes such as study time, previous academic performance, and family support were found to be most significant.</p>

   <h3>3. Model Selection</h3>
    <p>Various machine learning algorithms were tested to determine the best-performing model, including:</p>
  <ul>
       <li>Linear Regression Model Only</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Model Evaluation</h3>
  <p>The models were evaluated using metrics such as:</p>
   <ul>
        <li>Using Accuracy Score</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Programming Language</strong>: Python</li>
        <li><strong>Libraries</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Pandas, NumPy: for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
                <li>Scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.</li>
                <li>Matplotlib, Seaborn: for data visualization.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
   </ul>

 
  <h2>Future Work</h2>
   <ul>
        <li><strong>Model Improvement</strong>: Experiment with hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods for improved accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Develop a user-friendly dashboard for real-time student performance prediction in educational institutions.</li>
  </ul>
